# Mywork


1.	Create a function that accepts a string and change every letter in the string to the next letter.
o	The function will display the converted string and will not return any value.
o	Example: "a" becomes "b", "b" becomes "c" and so on.
o	Note: "z" will be changed to "a". The function is case-sensitive.

2.	Create a function that accepts an array of two strings and checks if ALL the letters in the second string are present in the first string.
o	The function will return true or false.
o	Example: 
	["melon", "lemon"] => true
	["entrance", "nectar"] => true
	["reap", "drape"] => false
	["finished", "finnish"] => false

3.	Triangular Number Sequence is generated from a pattern of dots that form a triangle (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number). 
o	The first 5 numbers of the sequence are 
	1, 3, 6, 10, 15
o	This means that the first triangle has just one dot, the second has three, the third has 6 and so on.
o	Write a function that accepts the triangle number of the sequence (n) and returns the corresponding number of dots.
o	Example: 
	TriangularNumberSequence(3) => 6
	TriangularNumberSequence(6) => 21
